This directory and its subdirectories hold examples that demonstrate
various aspects of LuaVIEW. The Lua scripts can be started using the
"LuaVIEW Task Manager" and can be examined using any text editor.
The VIs can be loaded and run from within the LabVIEW development
environment. The VI templates serve as starting points for the
implementation of recurring types of VIs. Their diagrams contain
comments that explain their function and how they can be specialized.
Remember to save a template under a new name when starting to
specialize it.

Note that some example scripts contain paths that need adjustment in
order to run on the Mac.
