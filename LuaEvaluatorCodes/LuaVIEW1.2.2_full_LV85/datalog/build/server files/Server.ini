; Unfortunately, LabVIEW GUIs do not cope well with
; changing font sizes. To avoid ugliness, we force
; the font used to lay out the various GUIs. This is
; just the default LabVIEW font on Windows.

; The native file dialog looks nicer, but it blocks the UI

; The locale of some countries uses ',' instead of '.' as
; the decimal point separator. LuaVIEW overrides this both
; on the Lua side as well as by forcing '.' on the LabVIEW
; side whenever format codes are used. However, this is easy
; to forget when adding customisations. To make doubly sure,
; the False setting below will globally cause LabVIEW to
; ignore the locale settings for the decimal point.
useLocaleDecimalPt=False
; To be able to build a minimal server executable that loads
; as much as possible dynamically, specify search paths that
; allow the application to load any VIs that cannot be located
; via relative paths, in particular the vi.lib and instr.lib
; VIs. The simplest solution is to point to the vi.lib and
; instr.lib directories of the LabVIEW distribution, or copies
; thereof.
