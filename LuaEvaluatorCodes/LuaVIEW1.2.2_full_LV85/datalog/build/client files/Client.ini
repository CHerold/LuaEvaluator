; The locale of some countries uses ',' instead of '.' as
; the decimal point separator. LuaVIEW overrides this both
; on the Lua side as well as by forcing '.' on the LabVIEW
; side whenever format codes are used. However, this is easy
; to forget when adding customisations. To make doubly sure,
; the False setting below will globally cause LabVIEW to
; ignore the locale settings for the decimal point.
