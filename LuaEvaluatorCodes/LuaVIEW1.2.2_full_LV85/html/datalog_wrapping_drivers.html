<title>Wrapping instrumentation drivers</title>
</head>

<body>

<h3>Wrapping instrumentation drivers</h3>
<p>LabVIEW offers a rich environment for instrumentation programming and has
many features for analysis and display. By closely integrating the data logger
and Lua with LabVIEW, it was ensured that the full power of the LabVIEW
development environment remains available: the limitations inherent in combining
loosely coupled systems are avoided. This is of particular value when new
instrumentation must be integrated.</p>

<p>Instead of calling an instrument driver directly, it is often useful to wrap
it in some code so as to abstract or simplify access, or encapsulate instrument
management. <u>Abstraction</u> is possible by exposing the physical values or
parameters sensed or controlled by the instrument in a manner that hides
instrument-specific details. This makes the code that uses the wrapper more
readable and less dependent on the particulars of the instrument. By exposing a <u>simplified</u>
view of the instrument, a wrapper can hide the full complexity of the
instrumentation driver and provide an interface tailored to the subset of the
instrument's functionality that is actually being used. By <u>encapsulating</u>
the configuration, initialisation, state tracking, and so on, a wrapper can hide
instrument management operations from the rest of the system.</p>
<p>As is clear from the above, it is impossible to provide a one-size-fits-all
wrapper solution: the best choice depends not just on the details of the
instrument, but also on the needs of the application using the instrument.
Still, there are some common issues that arise when trying to talk to
instrumentation. This appendix aims to bring those issues into focus and assist with programming wrappers.
Some general advice is given in the first two sections:</p>

<h4><a name="Exploring the instrument">Exploring the instrument</a></h4>

<p>When the instrument is complicated, it is necessary to become familiar
with its capabilities and quirks before commencing with writing a wrapper. This
typically involves writing little LabVIEW test programs that use the
instrument's driver to explore the various required operations. This section lists some random tips and
warnings
to aid with this task:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Before buying instrumentation, verify the availability and quality of
    LabVIEW drivers. Most manufacturers offer some LabVIEW support.</li>
  <li>If the instrument connects via an interface, bus, or protocol that is
    well-supported by LabVIEW (serial, GPIB, and TCP/IP in particular) and
    has a simple command set, it will be fairly easy to program the instrument
    from LabVIEW. In such cases the absence of a manufacturer-supplied or third-party
    LabVIEW driver is inconvenient but not a show-stopper.</li>
  <li>When no LabVIEW driver is provided with an instrument, and it does not
    accept text-formatted commands or operate according to a standard protocol
    either, the instrument will nearly always ship with a DLL that is
    designed to be called from C. LabVIEW and Lua can make calls to DLLs and
    support
    most, though not all, of the kinds parameters these DLL calls might require.
    But using DLL calls is fairly involved and error-prone. Expect to invest more
    time in getting things to run.</li>
  <li>National Instrument hardware tends to come with good LabVIEW support. This
    saves time, and thus money.</li>
  <li>The best choice of hardware is in part based on the number of instruments
    to be deployed. For small quantities, paying a premium for instrumentation with good driver support is usually more cost-effective than
    spending time doing a custom implementation just because the hardware is
    cheaper.</li>
  <li>Read the manual of the instrument to determine its functionality and
    decide what subset of that functionality is required for your application.</li>
  <li>Verify the instrument's operational performance. Most instruments have
    quirks. Some instruments do not perform according to their specifications.
    Many instruments require properly conditioned signals. Often, instrument
    operations have timing or state dependencies and thus might not work
    consistently without appropriate delays or preparations.</li>
  <li>Verify the driver's performance. Measure how many I/Os per
    second the driver supports. Some drivers are just too slow. Some
    drivers operate efficiently only when running in buffered or DMA mode. Some
    drivers block the current thread by calling into CINs or DLLs for prolonged
    periods of time. Depending on the execution system the driver is run under,
    this might block other operations of your application.</li>
  <li>Be wary of using convenience VIs. Often, convenience VIs are provided that
    encapsulate instrument initialisation, operation, and cleanup. Repeated use
    of such VIs can cause a lot unnecessary overhead. In such cases the lower-level VIs should be used so that the initialisation and cleanup can be
    performed only once.</li>
  <li>External configuration tools such as NI's
    &quot;Measurement and Automation Explorer&quot; or &quot;FieldPoint
    Explorer&quot; help make instrumentation available to LabVIEW while also providing for
    scaling and channel naming and mapping. This is fine when exploring the
    instrument, but avoid making the wrapper depend on such tools if possible: their configuration
    is stored externally, tends to lack or offer a limited programmatic
    interface, and muddles together the distinct concepts of
    physical value, sensor, channel, and scaling.</li>
  <li>Measure acquisition latency. When writing to data logger tags, the signal and/or set
    points of the instrument must be time stamped. This can be done by applying
    the current system clock, but such a simple approach can introduce
    inaccuracies depending on the type of instrument. Some instruments have a
    long latency e.g. because of buffering and filtering. If this latency is
    appreciable relative to the precision of temporal correlation you need, it
    must be corrected for.</li>
  <li>Decide whether and how to use any timing and synchronisation features
    provided the instrument. Some have a built in clock for time stamping. Some
    have a clock that drives I/O conversions. Some accept an external clock
    source or a trigger. This can help avoid inaccurate software timing.
    However, a lot of effort can be sunk into mutually synchronizing
    instruments, or synchronizing instruments to the system clock.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="Managing and tracking instrument state">Managing and tracking instrument state</a></h4>

<p>To encapsulate as many instrumentation-specific details as possible, wrappers
for complex instruments need to manage and keep track of the state. Where
possible, the wrapper should hide the details of this management from its
interface to the wider system. Management and tracking can include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Initialisation</b> of the instrumentation when the wrapper is
    loaded/instantiated.</li>
  <li><b>Resetting</b> the instrumentation when the
    wrapper is unloaded/cleaned up.</li>
  <li><b>Keeping track of response delays.</b> Often, an instrument will take a while
    to respond to a command, and it might even drop further commands in the mean
    time. In such a case, the wrapper should wait for a completion response with
    an appropriate timeout . If
    the instrument does not support such confirmation, further commands should
    be delayed until the instrument can be assumed to be ready.</li>
  <li><b>Recovering from errors.</b> Some driver errors can be ignored or
    handled by retrying. Whether an error is recoverable or intermittent is
    highly dependent on the instrument and its interfacing. To prevent such
    details from leaking into the wider application, retries and eating spurious
    errors should be taken care of by the wrapper.</li>
  <li><b>Explaining errors.</b> Driver errors are usually unintelligible. When they do occur,
    adding state and
    configuration information as available to the wrapper can help turn them
    into something that an operator is capable of understanding and acting upon.</li>
  <li><b><a name="Locking and arbitration">Locking and arbitration</a>.</b> When instrument operations can mutually
    conflict, or when aggregate operations must proceed in a particular order,
    it is necessary to block access to the device for the duration of an
    operation or series of operations. The simplest solution is to wrap such
    operations in a single non-reentrant subVI since these can have only one
    caller at a time. A more advanced alternative is to use a semaphore.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that there is not necessarily a one-on-one relation between wrappers and
instruments. Sometimes, the only way to effectively hide instrumentation details
is to jointly manage the state of multiple instruments. Consider
for example a digital multimeter fronted by a separate multiplexer. A simple
interface can only be presented by having a single wrapper encapsulate the drivers of
both these co-operating instruments.</p>

<h4><a name="Providing an asynchronous interface through tags">Providing an asynchronous interface through tags</a></h4>

<p>The important physical parameters and signals controlled or acquired by an
instrument often need to be exposed to allow things like monitoring, test
scripting, signal analysis, and so on. Instead of inventing an ad-hoc interface
for each wrapper, it is preferable to have wrappers of various
instruments present a more general and uniform interface. <a href="datalog_manual.html#Representing%20state%20as%20tags">Tags</a>
allow just that. By writing acquired physical values to tags, or reading
parameter settings from tags, an instrument wrapper can provide an abstract
interface to the rest of the system that is made up of a set of tags. This
interface is accessible from both Lua and LabVIEW. Because writing and reading
are decoupled, tags provide an asynchronous interface. The writer is free to
proceed and let the read process the data at its own pace. Note that tags can be used as
variables (by reading only the current value) or as queues (by exhaustively
reading the written values).</p>
<p>If possible, try to avoid exposing instrument-specific details through tags.
For example, writing calibrated values instead of raw sensor readings hides the
instrumentation-specific scaling. Ideally, only state that generalises, such as
physical values, is included in the tag interface. This makes it easier to
replace or simulate instruments because a sufficiently abstract tag interface can remain unchanged
when doing so.</p>

<h4><a name="Providing a synchronous interface through functions or subVIs">Providing a synchronous interface through functions or subVIs</a></h4>

<p>For certain tasks, an asynchronous interface is inconvenient or insufficient. For example, when performing a step in a test sequence, the corresponding instrumentation operation
has to be known to have completed before the next step can commence.
Asynchronous interfaces can be extended to support synchronous operation, for
example by having a message and reply queue and having the sender of the message
wait for a reply before commencing. This is
unnecessarily complicated. It is much simpler to use a callable interface
such that the operation is complete when the call returns without an error. For
example, a function that can be called from Lua, or a subVI that can be called
from LabVIEW. Since a wrapper is likely to be used by multiple test scripts or
control loops, investing some effort to provide a simple synchronous interface tends to pay for itself.</p>
<p>When providing a callable interface, the first question to answer is what
language it is to be called from. When calling from LabVIEW, having the wrapper
expose instrument operations through a set of subVIs is a simple solution. It is however
incompatible with dynamically loading the instrument wrapper. Also, when multiple
instruments of the same type are in use, it is desirable to avoid code
duplication by instantiating the same wrapper multiple times. This makes the use
of a direct subVI interface impossible as well. For objected-oriented languages,
this would be a trivial problem since these include class loaders and can
instantiate objects that expose methods. To get around this LabVIEW limitation,
several frameworks have been developed that leverage VI-server and
call-by-reference functionality to provide a limited object-oriented-programming
(OOP) capability. However OOP is fundamentally different from data-flow
programming. Mixing the two leads to ugly code that does not look like what it
does, thus defeating the whole point of graphical programming. Instead of trying to make a dog
walk on its hind legs, consider calling wrappers from Lua when dynamic loading and
instantiation are prerequisites.</p>
<p>When calling from Lua, expose the synchronous instrument operations by <a href="creating_functions.html">binding</a>
LabVIEW driver code as LuaVIEW functions. All types of LuaVIEW function are
compatible with dynamic loading. <a href="manual.html#Modules">Module</a> functions and
methods attached to <a href="datatypes.html#LuaVIEW objects">LuaVIEW objects</a>
are compatible with instantiation.
Since Lua is suited for OOP, the calling code will look pretty.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is useful to log information on a synchronous operation. If so,
the wrapper should write to a corresponding tag when performing that operation.
To provide the most choice, make the tag name and the enabling of tag writing
configurable.
Though the data logger also allows disk logging to be disabled per tag, disabling the in-memory writes to a tag reduces overhead even further and makes
that the tag need not exist until writing is enabled.</p>
<h4><a name="Wrapping with a task and a module">Wrapping with a task and a
module</a></h4>
<p>Wrappers can be implemented in pure LabVIEW or as some mix of Lua and
LabVIEW. A combination of a <a href="manual.html#Tasks">LuaVIEW task</a> and a <a href="manual.html#Modules"> LuaVIEW
module</a> is likely to be a particularly efficient choice provided that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The wrapper does not need to expose a synchronous interface to LabVIEW.</li>
  <li>The wrapper has to manage a non-trivial bit of instrumentation.</li>
</ol>
<p>When these conditions are met, create a customised module (for an example,
see luaview/examples/VI templates/Module Template.vit) and write a task
script that opens or instantiates the module while passing the required
configuration parameters as a table. Typical examples of such parameters are
instrument IDs, scaling factors, channel mappings, and so on. When required,
define module <a href="manual.html#Exporting module functions">export functions</a> to expose a synchronous Lua-callable interface.
The remainder of the task script can be used to perform periodic or event-driven
actions. Private module functions can be defined to support these actions.</p>
<p>For example, the task script can do one or some combination of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Periodically poll an attached sensor by calling a module function and
    write the result to a tag.</li>
  <li>Read new values from a set point tag and call a module function to update
    the corresponding instrument setting.</li>
  <li>Wait for command messages to arrive on the task message queue and call an
    appropriate module function or series of module functions to execute the
    command. This is an alternative asynchronous interface with minimal response latency and no polling
    overhead.</li>
  <li>Define a <a href="lv_c-library_functions.html#lv.addcleanup">cleanup
    function</a> that resets the instrumentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>This mix is efficient for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It can make do with just a single script and a single VI.</li>
  <li>It leverages the task and module infrastructure.</li>
  <li>It separates the wrapper
into a set of LabVIEW-implemented instrumentation operations and Lua-implemented
configuration and scheduling actions, thus playing into the strengths of both languages.</li>
  <li>Both a module or module instance allows only a single ongoing call thereby
    providing <a href="#Locking and arbitration">locking and arbitration</a> of
    the driver operations.</li>
  <li>Because the module passes errors out to Lua on completion of each function
    call, error handling is simplified.</li>
</ul>
<p>The resulting wrapper can be loaded by starting its task script, reconfigured by editing its task script, reloaded with a new configuration at
run time by <a href="manual.html#Swapping tasks">swapping</a> its task, and integrated into a
<a href="clientsrv_manual.html#Server">
server</a> by making the task script part of a <a href="clientsrv_manual.html#Runlevels">runlevel</a>.</p>
