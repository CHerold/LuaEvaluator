<title>LuaVIEW Client-Server Application Framework</title>
</head>

<body>

<p> LuaVIEW offers building blocks for scripting and bottom-up programming. The client-server application framework
provides an example of how to set up a script-driven application using
these building blocks. When you need to set up an application that must be
highly configurable or where performance and stability is an overriding concern,
this framework provides a good starting point.</p>

<h3><a name="About">About</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.citengineering.com/LuaVIEW/">LuaVIEW</a> client-server application framework
is copyright © 2003-2005 by <a href="http://www.citengineering.com">CIT Engineering</a>
and was implemented and documented by
Albert-Jan Brouwer and Roland van Zanten.</p>
<h3><a name="Installation">Installation</a></h3>
<p>The client-server framework is included in the LuaVIEW distribution, but is
not installed by default. The framework files are contained in the &quot;clientsrv.zip&quot;
archive located in the distribution's root
directory. To install the archive, extract it where it is located. When asked to
replace already existing files answer affirmatively. This will overwrite the clientsrv/ subdirectory, which by default contains a
couple of stubs that disable the client-server functionality. It is advisable to
mass compile the subdirectory afterwards by
selecting Tools&gt;Advanced&gt;Mass Compile from the LabVIEW menu. To uninstall
the framework, replace the clientsrv/ directory with the stubs
contained in the main LuaVIEW distribution archive, or simply <a href="manual.html#Installation">reinstall
LuaVIEW</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
<p>When setting up an application there are matters of architecture and policy that
need to
be arranged for. These include initialisation, configuration, access
arbitration, security, as well as means of handling or logging errors and
warnings. Policy tends to be fluid. By setting policies through scripts they can
be easily changed even after deploying the application as a built executable.
Architecture is more static, but when a LabVIEW-based architecture needs
changing it tends to be painful because LabVIEW is compiled, lacks adequate
abstractions for high-level programming, and ties code up with wires. The
framework has a script-based architecture that provides ample flexibility for
projects with evolving requirements.</p>
<p>The framework is split into two components. The main component is a script-based
<b>server</b>  that can be started by running &quot;clientsrv/ClientSrv
Example Server.vi&quot;. The server provides a flexible means of starting and managing
sets of <a href="manual.html#Tasks"> tasks</a> that define what the application does: tasks can make use of any
type of LuaVIEW building block and can run or execute LabVIEW VIs. The server is
fully coordinated through scripts, it does not have a user interface. Graphical
user interfaces (GUIs) are provided by the optional <b>client</b>
component that can be started by running &quot;clientsrv/ClientSrv Client.vi&quot;.
The client provides a start menu for an extensible set of GUIs.</p>
<p>To give both components a try, start both the server and the client. The
client is capable of connecting over TCP/IP to a server running on a remote
machine. To connect to the local machine select Server&gt;Connect from the
client menu and specify &quot;localhost&quot; as the machine name in the
connection dialog. Password fields can be left empty because none are configured
for the example server. To run the server on the Mac, some paths specified in
scripts may need adjustment [<a href="#1">1</a>].</p>

<h3><a name="Server">Server</a></h3>
<p>The server is set up in analogy with the boot procedure of an operating
system. It consists of a series of scripts that arrange for the global
configuration, registration of functions, and the configuration and starting of
system services. Though much simpler than a typical OS boot procedure, the
purpose of these scripts is the same: to support a freely configurable and
selectable set of services and tasks. The server is very lean: in its bare form
it consists of a relatively small number of VIs that have only a couple of
dependencies on VI.lib functions. Any further functionality is dynamically
loaded and linked, and is therefore optional. The following sections will discuss the various stages of initialisation of the
server.</p>
<h4><a name="Bootstrapping">Bootstrapping</a></h4>
<p>When you start &quot;clientsrv/ClientSrv
Example Server.vi&quot; the script clientsrv/resources/bootstrap.lua will be
executed using the <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Bootstrap.vi">Bootstrap</a> API VI.
The bootstrap script <a href="manual.html#Registering function VIs">registers</a> a selection of LuaVIEW
functions for later scripts and <a href="manual.html#Configuration">configures</a>
global system settings. Of particular note is the &quot;resource base path&quot;
which is set to the directory containing the bootstrap script, that is, the
clientsrv/resources/ subdirectory. By placing all scripts and other resources
that define the server inside a resources directory and accessing them via relative paths, moving the
server resources around or choosing between independent server configurations
becomes a simple matter of redefining this one absolute path. To resolve relative paths,
retrieve the resource base path using the <a href="clientsrv_functions.html#resources"><code>resources</code></a>
function from Lua or call &quot;library/file handling/Library Absolve Resource Path.vi&quot;
from LabVIEW.
</p>

<p>Switching between wholly independent server configurations is
prone to replication of functionality. It is therefore often preferable to
instead perform
conditional initialisation and configuration within the context of a single set
of resource scripts. The bootstrap script shows how to
use the <a href="luaview_functions.html#app_kind"><code>app_kind</code></a>
 function to perform initialisation depending on whether the server runs under
the development system or as a built application. For the same reason there is a
&quot;bootmode&quot; configuration parameter that can be accessed using the <a href="clientsrv_functions.html#bootmode"><code>bootmode</code></a>
function from Lua or by accessing the &quot;bootmode&quot; global inside &quot;luaview/glb_LuaVIEW Configuration Globals.vi&quot;
from LabVIEW.</p>

<h4><a name="Access">Access</a></h4>

<p>The last step in the bootstrap script starts the clientsrv/resources/access.lua
script which constitutes the next stage of the server initialisation. Its job is
to configure remote access of the server by clients. This access is based on the
VI-server LabVIEW protocol which allows one LabVIEW runtime to call VIs inside
another LabVIEW runtime over the network. Note though that it is possible to run
both client and server inside the same runtime, which is convenient during
development.</p>

<p>In addition to the standard VI-server configuration settings, you can
configure passwords for the two access levels (operator and observer) as well as
specify a timeout for the highest (operator) access level. Please refer to the
comments inside the access script for details. As shown below, multiple clients
can connect to a single server. The server arbitrates access such that only one
of the connected clients can have operator access at any one time.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="pics/clients.png" width="363" height="237"></p>

<p>Connected clients have observer access by default, which allows the state of
the server to be read but not changed [<a href="#1">2</a>]. The client with operator access is in addition able to
make changes to the state of the server. Sometimes it is handy to run multiple
servers, for example when you have multiple measurement computers in a
laboratory. In such a situation clients can choose to connect to one or the
other server.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="pics/servers.png" width="494" height="237"></p>

<p>To be able to easily discriminate between the servers when accessing them
remotely it is possible to specify a name for each. Note that a client can only
be connected to a single server at any one time.</p>

<p>In addition to arranging for access, the access script starts two service
tasks named &quot;errors&quot; and &quot;warnings&quot;. These tasks log error
and warning message sent to them. In terms of implementation they are almost
identical. The difference is semantic: a warning notifies users of something
that is about to happen or might go wrong, an error notifies users of something that has gone
wrong. The client is capable of showing both the warnings and errors console of the
server it is connected to through the Server&gt;Show Warnings and Server&gt;Show
Errors menu items. When server-side errors or warnings occur when the client is
connected, these consoles open automatically.</p>

<h4><a name="Runlevels">Runlevels</a></h4>

<p>When the access script is done, the clientsrv/resources/runlevels.lua script
is started. It specifies a series of runlevels. Each runlevel is a task script
that starts further tasks and/or provides some service. The purpose of runlevels is to enforce a well-defined
order of initialisation so that tasks in a runlevel can assume the presence of
resources initialised in earlier runlevels. In addition, they allow the server to
be brought up to or brought back down to a particular level of initialisation. This
is convenient when testing and also helps to make changes to a running server
without completely stopping it: after having changed the resources initialised
by a runlevel, it suffices to bring the server down to the prior runlevel and bring it back up,
thus rerunning the runlevel script and applying the made changes.</p>

<p>The remainder of the
runlevels task script provides a service that performs runlevel changes. It
can be used by <a href="luaview_functions.html#msg.send">sending a message</a>
to the &quot;runlevels&quot; task that contains the name of the runlevel to
change to. You can also interactively change runlevels by selecting one from the
Server&gt;Runlevels submenu of a connected client. In addition to runlevels,
the runlevels.lua script also configures the names
of allowed bootmodes. The bootmode used when starting the server is checked
against this list. To reboot the server
into a particular bootmode select Server&gt;Runlevels&gt;reboot. A dialog will
pop up that allows selection of the bootmode to use when multiple modes are
configured. Rebooting the server stops all active runlevels and completely
restarts it as of the bootstrap script.</p>

<p>When the runlevels task is started it by default remains at the &quot;stand
by&quot; runlevel which is the &quot;nothing activated&quot; runlevel that
precedes any of the custom configured runlevels. However when the server was not
cleanly shut down the last time it ran, the runlevels script assumes that the server is recovering
from a power outage or crash. In such an eventuality it will immediately change
to the runlevel that was active before. This mechanism allows a server to
recover and resume its operations after a machine reboot. It does however
require that you install the server such that it is automatically run when the
machine boots, e.g. by installing it as a Windows service.</p>

<h4><a name="Customisation">Customisation</a></h4>

<p>To dress up the server framework so as to create a custom application, first
determine how the required functionality can be divided into mutually
asynchronous subsets. Next, give each asynchronous subset its own <a href="manual.html#Tasks"> task</a>
script that schedules or starts the functionality. This does not impose
limitations since task scripts can make use of the various LuaVIEW building blocks
as well as
run or execute LabVIEW VIs.
</p>

<p>Once it is clear what tasks the application is to be comprised of, group the
tasks into runlevel scripts and add these to the runlevel table contained in the
runlevels.lua script. The runlevel grouping is partly dictated by the mutual
dependencies of tasks which impose an order of initialisation. Partly it depends
on the preferred granularity of initialisation: even when two subsystems can be
initialised simultaneously, it might still be desirable to place them in
separate runlevels so that one can be tested before the other.
</p>

<p>It is good practise to have a bootmode for testing that starts simulation
instead of instrumentation tasks. This allows the application to be run through
its paces without needing to connect instrumentation. Preferably provide LabVIEW-side functionality as <a href="creating_functions.html">function
VIs</a> or <a href="manual.html#Modules">modules</a> so that all the scheduling and error handling can be done
by scripts. Function VIs are useful for making brief bits of
LabVIEW functionality available. Modules work well for wrapping LabVIEW code
that manages some subsystem or a physical instrument.
</p>

<p>When
you need the best possible performance or have existing top-level VIs, it is
sometimes necessary to perform tasks completely in LabVIEW. You can do so simply by <a href="luaview_functions.html#VI.run">running</a>
 or <a href="luaview_functions.html#VI.execute">executing</a> a VI. However
this makes it difficult to pass configuration parameters from Lua or have the VI
return errors to Lua. Also, a normal VI executing inside a task context does
not respond to the
signals (stop, pause, resume) sent to that task. Fortunately, accepting
configuration parameters, handling signals, and throwing errors can be
added to an existing VI by converting it into a <a href="manual.html#Plug-ins">plug-in</a>.
</p>

<h3><a name="Client">Client</a></h3>
<p>The client displays a list of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that can be
started by double clicking or selection via the arrow keys and enter. Before
GUIs can be started, the client must be connected to a server. This can be done
by selecting the Server&gt;Connect menu item. When you have previously connected
to a server, it will show up in the submenu Server&gt;Server Presets to allow a
quick reconnect. After establishing a connection, the server name and its
bootmode show up in the client window so as to avoid confusion as to what server
is being accessed.</p>

<h4><a name="Sessions">Sessions</a></h4>

<p>The client collects the list of user interfaces by searching for VIs with a &quot;tui_&quot;
(top-level user interface) prefix. When starting a GUI, it is run as a top-level
VI. The GUIs that are included in the LuaVIEW distribution persist their
positions and some of their controls per server. When instantiated from a
template they accept instance arguments. The client persists the collection of
running GUIs and their arguments per server. The collection of open windows,
their arguments, state, and positions constitute a &quot;session&quot;. When
reconnecting to a server, the client restores the prior session. This allows you
to quickly switch from one to the other server: all the GUIs that were open on
disconnecting will be automatically reopened.</p>

<p>When multiple users of the same machine run the client under their own
account, each user will have separate persistence data. This is because the the
persistent GUI state is stored in files under the default LabVIEW data
directory, which is unique per user account. To persist state on a per-server
basis, the files are stored in a subdirectory with the same name as the
connected server. To clean up persistence data, select the Client&gt;Delete
Persistence Data menu item. A dialog will query the name of the server to delete
the persistence data for.</p>

<h4><a name="Editing">Editing</a></h4>

<p>Since the server is script-based, a text editor can replace many of the
configuration GUIs that would otherwise be required. Only when a particular
setting needs frequent or interactive changes is it worth the bother to
implement a GUI. To assist with editing server-side scripts, the Edit menu of
the client allows you to configure the text editor that you prefer to use.</p>

<p>When selecting Edit&gt;Remote File, a tree-based file dialog will pop up that
allows selection of a script residing in the resources directory on the server.
To allow the file to be edited on the client machine, it is first downloaded to
a temporary file. When you are done editing and exit the editor, the file is uploaded back to the
server, provided that changes were made. Note that saving the file from the
editor is not sufficient, the editor must be exited for the upload to commence.
The number of remote files that can be edited in parallel depends on the LabVIEW
configuration and platform. In single-threading mode, the limit is one. Otherwise, the limit
is three on Windows. On Linux up to at least LabVIEW version 7.1, only a single
editor can be opened because &quot;System Exec&quot; appears to be blocking the
UI thread.</p>

<p>Configuration through scripts has further advantages. For one, there is no
ambiguity as to when the changed configuration takes effect: this occurs when
the modified script is next run. Any errors on applying an invalid configuration
will refer back to the configuration script and offending line number within
that script. Also, configuration scripts allow conditional or iterative
configuration actions since they can contain arbitrary Lua code. A script can
document itself by adding comments that explain the configuration parameters.
Lastly, scripts are compact and readable, and therefore suitable for logging to
a historical record.</p>

<h4><a name="Purpose">Purpose</a></h4>

<p>The client is optional: the server can run without the client. When
customising the server framework, the simplest approach is to add GUIs to the
server and leave out the client and all the remote access related functionality,
and rename the server to something that reflects that it is no longer a server.
This simplifies matters since such GUIs will no longer be required to
communicate over the VI-server protocol. There is however a fairly narrow domain
of problems that benefits from operating
the server solely or mostly through a separate client. Remote access is in
itself <i>not</i> sufficient reason:
you can instead use VNC, remote panels, networked X, and so on, while retaining the simplicity of
programming associated with tying GUIs directly into your application.</p>

<p>The main purpose of the separate client is <i>server</i> <i>stability</i> and
<i>performance</i>. Running GUIs in a separate runtime allows offloading work and complexity from the server.
This is mandatory when the server
is performing mission-critical or latency-sensitive measurement and control tasks.
In general, while users are interactively using GUIs, it is impossible to guarantee
stability and consistent performance. Particular problems are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Presentation and analysis operations are easiest to implement by
    manipulating datasets in memory. This can cause marked system load and
    memory churn when the datasets are large or their size is input-dependent.
    Performing such operations in a client VI running on a separate machine
    prevents server load and latencies.</li>
  <li>Redrawing front panels, window manipulation, and use of other desktop
    applications tends to be CPU-intensive and cause scheduling latencies. The
    only way to avoid these is to run the server on an other machine than the
    client.</li>
  <li>There are several GUI-related
operations that block the UI thread. For example, simply using the &quot;One Button
    Dialog&quot; does so. Unfortunately, the UI thread is also required
when instantiating VIs. With GUIs in the same runtime you might therefore find
that your application blocks, even when running in multi-threading mode with the
various tasks nicely farmed out amongst the execution systems.</li>
  <li>GUIs cause crashes. Part of the reason is that when GUIs are being used,
    the code path taken is highly variable so that even when things work most of
    the time, a user might stumble across a bug eventually. Of course, such bugs
    should not be present, but GUI widgets are not very amenable to automated
    tests and involve a lot of complex C/C++ code. And erroneous C/C++ code
    mostly does not fail gracefully. Daily practice with LabVIEW (versions &lt;=
    7.1) indicates that most
    crashworthy bugs hide in the GUI periphery and not in the core
    functionality. This can be
    verified by running LabVIEW under <a href="http://valgrind.kde.org/">Valgrind</a>.
    Crashing a separate client runtime will cause only minor inconvenience instead of major disaster.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having to test under separate runtimes would be a major pain. The
framework is therefore set up such that client and server can also run inside
the same runtime. This allows refinement and testing inside a single development
environment. Separating the client and server can be postponed until deployment.
As a further convenience, the top-level GUI VIs can be individually run during
development without requiring a running server and client.</p>

<p>Client GUIs display data originating from the server. Thus, interactive GUI
use will still impact the server. However, remote calls over VI-server allow
fine-grained control over data transfer. When the client requires a handful of
small data items, it is possible to parcel them up on the server side and
transfer them in one go, thereby reducing the number of network packets. When
the client needs to transfer a large amount of data, it is possible to chunk up
the transfer and limit its duty cycle. See for example the subVIs used for
uploading and downloading files to and from the server.</p>

<p>Even after offloading all superfluous work and complexity,
you are still stuck with scheduling latencies caused by the underlying operating
system. Also, the stability of the server application can never be better than
the stability of the OS. Though average latencies are low when the system is not
taxed, worst-case latencies can easily exceed a hundred milliseconds on an OS
that is not real-time. To quantify the problem, <a href="performance.html#latency">measure
latency</a> under representative load conditions. When a guaranteed brief response time is required, the
only options are to use a real-time OS, a real-time controller, or a hardware
solution. When stability must be absolutely guaranteed, there is no substitute
for an embedded controller or a hardware implementation.</p>

<p>A lean server is a good solution for handling complex or multiple
&quot;soft&quot; real-time tasks that demand stability, particularly when backed up with a
hardware fail-safe such as a watchdog timer. Doing all instrumentation work and
online analysis inside the same LabVIEW runtime is much easier than farming out tasks to
external micro or real-time controllers so as to cope with GUI latencies. Of
course, these gains should outweigh the added complexity of a client-side
implementation of the interactively used GUIs. Handling all instrumentation in a
single server
runtime also makes it easier to implement a scripting interface [<a href="#2">3</a>]
that allows users to
write and test sequences or monitoring and feedback loops. Since Lua is
interpreted, such scripts can be modified and run without the need to either
rebuild or stop the server application.</p>

<h3><a name="Security">Security</a></h3>

<p>This section is of interest when you intend to deploy a client
and server combination on a network. Security is like a chain: it is only as strong as its weakest link. In
particular, server machines should not be physically accessible to untrusted
persons. When they are, any software-based access scheme only gives a false
sense of security. Also, security measures are often bypassed because of the
inconvenience they impose on users. The client-server access scheme
provided by the framework tries to avoid weak links without causing too much
hassle.</p>
<p>The access security is role-based instead of user-based. This makes it
practical to share a client machine amongst multiple users since there is no
need for each user to connect anew. When using the client to make a change to
the server, a dialog will request the password via which operator access is
obtained. To prevent this password from being repeatedly requested, the client
retains operator access afterwards. Operator access should be released when the client machine is about to be left unattended.
This can be done by selecting the Server&gt;Release Access menu item.</p>
<p>Of course, people will forget to release operator access. Though operator
access is exclusive, this should not prevent operators that use a different
client machine from obtaining operator access. It is therefore allowed to steal
operator access after having been notified that some other client is holding it,
but has not used it for a given amount of time. The password dialog also allows
a reason to be entered so as to notify users of other clients of why or by whom
operator access was grabbed. When running
clients might be left unattended in a location accessible to unauthorised
persons, configure the &quot;access timeout&quot; setting.
This will cause the server to automatically revoke operator access on expiry of
the specified timeout.</p>
<p>How secure is the scheme, really? The VI-server protocol is pretty obscure,
so there is a fair amount of up-front security through obscurity. It is possible
to configure an access list that allows only machines with particular IPs or
from particular domains to connect. When the client machines have static IP
addresses, listing them makes things pretty secure. However, IP
addresses are typically issued dynamically so that access lists can at best limit
connections to particular subnets.</p>
<p>Only VIs whose name ends with &quot;_srv.vi&quot; are made remotely callable
by the server. That way the client can only call server-side VIs specifically
designed for remote calling. When a client makes a remote call, the served VI
being called checks whether the client has passed a valid certificate before commencing
with the requested action. The certificates are issued by the server on checking
the digested access password provided by the client. No plaintext passwords are passed over the network. This server-side issuing
and checking makes it impossible to bypass the scheme by hacking the client.</p>
<p>The VI-server protocol is not encrypted.
This makes that any data sent over it, certificates in particular, can in principle be snooped
by a network sniffer and used in a spoofing attack. Such an advanced attack on a
very obscure scheme is unlikely, but there are no absolute
guarantees. Some added security is therefore advisable when operating over an
untrusted network such as the internet. Fortunately, it is possible to tunnel
the VI-server port through an ssh connection so that the VI-server communication
stream becomes encrypted. A VPN will also work, but installing one solely for this purpose is not advisable
since it introduces other risks by tunnelling all kinds of TCP/IP traffic.</p>
<p>A rather more likely risk is caused by the very network accessibility of the server.
Server machines that perform some critical measurement or control task should definitely not be
connected directly to the internet because of worms and viruses. But the
intranet of many medium to large organisations is not a safe place either since
there is always someone who manages to get troyaned or infected. Even though the
VI-server protocol is not at risk, other protocols run by the server machine
might have known exploits. Since measurement machines need to keep on running, it is
not always possible to keep up with the latest security fixes. And available
fixes might not have kept up with the latest attacks.</p>
<p>For these reasons it is advisable to isolate server machines inside a
laboratory subnet. This makes them accessible to clients on that same subnet. To also be
accessible to clients on the intranet, it is possible to set up a gateway
between the intranet and subnet that forwards the VI-server ports but no other
traffic. Gateway appliances are usually capable of this. When you set up a
gateway on a Linux machine, you can use the redirect option of xinetd. By using
a range of port numbers on the gateway it can front for multiple server machines
on the isolated subnet. The diagram below summarizes how to arrange for a secure
deployment when there are multiple servers, and clients connecting inside the lab, on the intranet, and over the internet.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="pics/networking.png" width="384" height="744"></p>
<p>When having isolated a server machine in this manner, it is no longer
possible to open a share or use some other protocol to remotely manage the files
on the server machine from outside the subnet. For this reason a &quot;Remote File Manager&quot; user
interface is provided that allows some basic file management over the VI-server
protocol. An added benefit is that a single port per server is easier to
administer than multiple protocols.</p>

<p>When you have deployed multiple client versions and the server requires a
particular client version, it is possible to specify a &quot;client
version&quot; string in the access configuration set via the access.lua script.
Setting this version string will require the client to provide it, thereby
ensuring that only clients of the appropriate version can connect. On the client
side, this string can be set in a global contained in clientsrv/glb_ClientSrv Globals.vi.
This can be particularly handy when there are many clients deployed on diverse
machines and new features are added that require an upgraded client: requiring
the new version will flush out any remaining users of the old client version.</p>

<p>[<a name="1">1</a>] On the Mac, relative paths start with a leading
separator. To further complicate matters, the Mac C library uses Unix paths
(with a '/' separator). C functions such as io.open therefore expect Unix paths.
It is likely that Mac paths will be dropped in favour of Unix paths in some
future LabVIEW release.</p>
