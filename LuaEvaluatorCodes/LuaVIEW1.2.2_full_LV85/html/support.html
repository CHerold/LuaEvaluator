<h3>Support</h3>
<p>The LuaVIEW distribution is designed to be self-supporting by providing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Example scripts and VIs.</li>
  <li>An extensive <a href="manual.html">manual</a>.</li>
  <li>Indexed function documentation.</li>
  <li>Appendices discussing special topics.</li>
  <li>User interfaces with VI descriptions, and context-sensitive help.</li>
  <li>SubVIs with usage and input/output descriptions.</li>
  <li>Commented VI diagrams.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the extent of the documentation appears daunting, start with the
examples and consume the documentation on an as-needed basis. To accommodate
such exploratory reading, the documentation is heavily laced with
cross-references and links to further online information. When a conceptual or
practical question arises that does not seem to be covered, have a look at the <a href="http://www.citengineering.com/LuaVIEW/faq.html">FAQ</a>.
The documentation is intended to be sufficiently comprehensive to describe and
motivate all LuaVIEW features and provide guidance with their use. When you run
into a feature that is not properly explained or stumble across other documentation
mistakes, please <a href="http://www.citengineering.com/luaview/bugs.html"> file a bug
report</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://lists.luaforge.net/mailman/listinfo/luaview-users">mailing
list</a> has been set up to serve as a discussion forum for LabVIEW programmers
that use the LuaVIEW toolkit. It can be used to share experiences or ask questions whose answers might be general interest. Also, announcements regarding the future of LuaVIEW
are posted there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lua itself is endowed with a wealth of supporting resources. See for example the Lua <a href="http://www.lua.org">home page</a>,
the <a href="http://lua-users.org">Lua users</a> site, and <a href="http://luaforge.net/">LuaForge</a>.
Beyond the Lua-specific support, discussions of scripting-related design
patterns and strategies are applicable to Lua: though differing in syntactic
detail, Lua offers the same spectrum of language features as provided by other
modern scripting languages such as Python and Ruby.</p>
