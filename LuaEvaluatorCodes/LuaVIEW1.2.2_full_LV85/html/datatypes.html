<h3>Data types</h3>

<p>Data can be passed between
the Lua and LabVIEW side by means of a Lua stack. To pass data to Lua, use <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Push _poly_.vi">Push
(poly)</a> to push data onto the stack. To retrieve data from Lua, use <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Pull _poly_.vi">Pull
(poly)</a> to pull elements off the stack. Both VIs are polymorphic and allow
the type of data
being pushed or pulled to be selected. This document details which types are
supported and what conversions are made when translating them between Lua and
LabVIEW: </p>

</ul>
<h4><a name="Numerical types">Numerical types</a> </h4>

<p>Lua has just one numerical type, the &quot;number&quot; type, which uses
double precision floating point representation. This implies that it can store
all the LabVIEW integer types as well as single and double precision floats
without loss of information. Use <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Push _number_.vi"> Push
(number)</a> and <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Pull _number_.vi">
Pull (number)</a> for both singles (wire with conversion dots) and doubles. All
LabVIEW integer types have corresponding push and pull
VIs. The <a href="lv_c-library_functions.html">&quot;lv&quot;
C library</a>  contains functions to perform bit-wise and overflow-sensitive
operations on Lua numbers that hold integer values. </p>

<p>To avoid unintended information loss, no push and pull support is provided for extended
precision floats, complex numbers, physical numbers (with associated units), and 128-bit
timestamps. If such types must be passed and the information loss is tolerable,
wire an explicit conversion to/from a
supported type before/after pushing or pulling. </p>

<h4><a name="Strings">Strings</a> </h4>

<p>Lua has a string type that is precisely compatible with LabVIEW strings: like
a LabVIEW string, a Lua string can be of arbitrary length and hold all 8 bit
character values, including null characters. Use <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Push _string_.vi"> Push
(string)</a> and
<a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Pull _string_.vi">
Pull (string)</a>  to pass strings to/from Lua. </p>

<h4><a name="Booleans">Booleans</a> </h4>

<p>Both LabVIEW and Lua have Boolean types. Use <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Push _boolean_.vi"> Push
(boolean)</a> and
<a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Pull _boolean_.vi">
Pull (boolean)</a>  to pass Booleans to/from Lua. </p>

<h4><a name="Compound data">Compound data</a> </h4>

<p>Compound data (a combination of more primitive data elements) such as an
array or cluster can be represented using a Lua table. To remove the need for
passing such data element-by-element, LuaVIEW provides <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Push _flat data_.vi">
Push (flat data)</a> and <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Pull _flat data_.vi">
Pull (flat data)</a> for
pushing and pulling compound data. These functions require a type descriptor
as can be obtained from &quot;Flatten To String&quot;, &quot;Variant To
Flattened String&quot;, or the &quot;Type Descriptor&quot; control/indictor
property. To understand what these VIs do it helps to think of <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Push _flat data_.vi">
Push (flat data)</a> as &quot;Unflatten To Lua&quot; and <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Pull _flat data_.vi">
Pull (flat data)</a> as &quot;Flatten From Lua&quot;. By combining them with
their LabVIEW unflatten and flatten complements, compound data of arbitrary
complexity and nesting can be passed. </p>

<p>To push an array or cluster to Lua, first use &quot;Flatten To String&quot;: </p>

<p><img border="0" src="pics/pushing_compound.png" width="230" height="88"> </p>

<p>To pull and array or cluster from Lua while requiring that it be fully
specified, convert the pulled flat data using &quot;Unflatten From String&quot;
and leave the default data input unwired: </p>

<p><img border="0" src="pics/pulling_compound.png" width="459" height="121"> </p>

<p>Note that there is no need to examine the error output of &quot;Unflatten
From String&quot; since the pull is guaranteed to either return valid flat data
matching the type descriptor, or an error and an empty string. To pull an array
or cluster with optional substitution of default data, proceed as follows: </p>

<p><img border="0" src="pics/pulling_default.png" width="503" height="117"> </p>

<p>When the stack is empty or contains a nil, the entire default array/cluster
is substituted. When a cluster is required, and the table is lacking some
entries corresponding to cluster elements, the appropriate elements will be
substituted from the default cluster. Think of it as a &quot;Bundle By
Name&quot; that does not specify all cluster elements. This also works for
nested clusters, but not for clusters contained in arrays. </p>

<p>To push a variant <i>without</i> any attributes it may have, first use
&quot;Variant To Flattened String&quot;: </p>

<p><img border="0" src="pics/pushing_a_variant.png" width="177" height="85"> </p>

<p>To pull data into a variant, convert the pulled flat data using
&quot;Flattened String To Variant&quot;: </p>

<p><img border="0" src="pics/pulling_a_variant.png" width="262" height="85"> </p>

<p>Be sure to <i>wire the variant output</i> before testing your VI: there is a
null pointer bug in LabVIEW 7.0 that manifests itself when executing
&quot;Flattened String To Variant&quot; without a wired variant output. </p>

<h4><a name="Lots of compound data">Lots of compound data</a> </h4>

<p>The flat data push and pull VIs come in reentrant and non-reentrant versions that are otherwise equivalent. When lots of compound data is to be pushed or pulled,
use the reentrant version so that the non-reentrant variant is never blocked for
a prolonged time. Solely using the reentrant version is sure to prevent
contention, but reentrant VIs use up more memory, particularly when placed on
the diagram of a VI that is a template or itself reentrant. In general, the
optimum compromise is to use reentrant VIs only when there is a real risk of
contention. </p>

<h4><a name="Restrictions on compound data">Restrictions on compound data</a> </h4>

<p>Since Lua cannot represent all types that LabVIEW can, and vice versa, there
are some restrictions on the compound data that can be handled: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Currently, compound data may contain only the following data types:
    arrays, clusters, any of the integer types, single precision floats, double
    precision floats, strings, paths, Booleans, enums, and most flavours of
    refnum (see below).</li>
  <li>All cluster elements must have unique names so that a table with string
    keys can be used to represent them.</li>
  <li>When converting a table into a cluster, it may only contain entries with
    string keys, and these keys must match names of cluster elements.</li>
  <li>When pushing a multi-dimensional array, it may not have zero-length
    dimensions that precede dimensions of non-zero length since this cannot be
    uniquely represented using tables. A multi-dimensional array with all
    dimensions set to zero-length is represented with an empty table. Note that
    the number of dimensions is contained in the type descriptor.</li>
  <li> When pulling multi-dimensional arrays from a nested
table, the tables at the same level of nesting must have the same number of
array elements. For example, when an array with two dimensions and integer
entries is required, the table <code>{{1,2},{3,4}}</code> is valid and the
    table
<code>{{1,2},{3}}</code>  is invalid.</li>
</ul>

<p> When one of
these restrictions is violated, a descriptive error will be returned. There are
also a couple of instances where there are less restrictions on the data than
you might expect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When pulling a table into an array, the entries
at key [1], [2], [3], and so on, are converted until no further entry is found.
Other entries, e.g. entries with string keys, are ignored. This
implies that you can annotate an array-like table, but loose the annotation on
conversion to a LabVIEW array.</li>
  <li>Using <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Push _flat data_.vi">
Push (flat data)</a> and <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Pull _flat data_.vi">
Pull (flat data)</a>  it is also possible to pass single data elements
    provided that they belong to one of the data types that are allowed as part
    of compound data. This might seem useless since there are type-specific push
    and pull VIs that are easier to wire. However, it is useful for generalizing
    an implementation by having the data type to be passed be dynamically
    determined through a type descriptor. See the implementation of <a href="luaview_functions.html#VI.get_control">VI.</a><a href="luaview_functions.html#VI.get_control">get_control</a>
    for an example.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that Lua tables with string keys as used for clusters do not have a defined
    entry order: the keys are hashed for speedy lookup. When you need to process
    entries based on the cluster order, use the <b>include cluster
    order</b> option of <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Push _flat data_.vi">
Push (flat data)</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="Enums">Enums</a> </h4>

<p>Lua does not have an enum type. However, it is possible to convert an
enum value into a string. The reverse is possible as long as the string
corresponds to one of the enum items. Thus, it is possible to represent any
LabVIEW enum as a Lua string. Representing the enum as a Lua number is not
desirable since this makes for less readable scripts that become outdated when
items are added or removed from the LabVIEW enum definition. </p>

<p>To push an enum as a string to Lua use &quot;Format Into String&quot;
followed by <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Push _string_.vi">Push (string)</a> 
as follows: </p>

<p><img border="0" src="pics/pushing_an_enum.png" width="193" height="83"> </p>

<p>To pull a string as an enum from Lua, use &quot;Flatten To String&quot;, <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Pull _flat data_.vi">Pull (flat
data)</a>, and &quot;Unflatten From String&quot; as follows: </p>

<p><img border="0" src="pics/pulling_an_enum.png" width="347" height="121"> </p>

<p>When <a href="#Compound data"> pushing and pulling compound data</a> containing an
enum, the conversion to/from a string happens automatically. When a LuaVIEW
function has an enum parameter or result, the <a href="creating_functions.html#The calling synopsis">calling
synopsis</a> should specify a <b>str</b>  typecode. </p>

<h4><a name="Paths">Paths</a> </h4>

<p>LabVIEW paths are represented with Lua strings. Use <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Pull _path_.vi">
Push (path)</a> to push a Lua string converted from a LabVIEW path. The
conversion is identical to LabVIEW's &quot;Path to String&quot; conversion
function. Use <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Pull _path_.vi">Pull (path)</a> to pull a Lua string and convert it into a LabVIEW path. By
default, any occurrences of &quot;\&quot; and &quot;/&quot; in the string are
first substituted with the platform-specific path separator. This behaviour may not
be desirable because &quot;\&quot; and &quot;/&quot; can occur in file or
directory names on some platforms. To disable substitution, use
<a href="lv_c-library_functions.html#lv.substitute_separators"><code>lv.substitute_separators()</code></a>.
The further string to path conversion is identical to LabVIEW's &quot;String to
Path&quot; conversion function. When passing paths as part of compound data, the
same conversions are performed on pushing and pulling. When a LuaVIEW
function has a path parameter or result, the <a href="creating_functions.html#The calling synopsis">calling
synopsis</a> should specify a <b>str</b>  typecode. Note that including a &quot;\&quot; in a string can be tricky because Lua
uses backslash as the escape character inside quoted strings. Either escape
the backslash, e.g. <code>"foo\\bar"</code>, or use a verbatim string, e.g. <code>[[foo\bar]]</code>. </p>

<p>If you do not care about script portability, specify platform-specific
paths as part of scripts and disable separator substitution. When script
portability is important, the conversion of &quot;\&quot;
and &quot;/&quot;, allows either to be used as a valid separator for all
platforms. The substitution with the platform-specific separator is done
automatically when pulling a path to LabVIEW.
When passing a path to a C function (e.g. one of the functions in the &quot;io&quot; library) no
substitution is performed. To force a conversion use the <a href="lv_c-library_functions.html#lv.topath"><code>lv.topath()</code></a>
function. To assist with constructing valid paths through string concatenation, the global <code>_SEP</code> is defined when opening a LuaVIEW state. It holds the platform-specific
path separator character as a string. </p>

<p>Relative directory paths specified as string constants are not portable to
the Mac: on Linux and Windows,
relative paths start without a separator, on the Mac, a relative path must start
with a separator. There are a few example scripts that include such paths. Add a leading
separator in order to make them work on the Mac as well. Since Mac OS X is
UNIX-based, it might well be that future LabVIEW versions for the Mac will adopt
the UNIX path conventions. Note that the LabVIEW path data type is
perfectly portable. An alternative road to portability is therefore to store paths on
the LabVIEW side and have scripts fetch them as required. </p>

<h4><a name="32-bit refnums">32-bit refnums</a> </h4>

<p>LabVIEW refnums come in all kinds of flavours. Most are represented as a 32-bit
value (the ones with thin grey-green wires). 32-bit refnums typically reflect C/C++ objects or data structures that are
not meant to be visible to LabVIEW. In Lua, there is not much that can be done with refnums other than pass them
back to LabVIEW. In particular, it is not allowed to modify refnums or otherwise
interpret their value. To make this impossible, 32-bit refnums are
represented on the Lua side as a &quot;light user data&quot;, which is an opaque 32 bit value.
Two such values can be compared for equality when they belong to the same
flavour. Refnums belonging to different flavours are not guaranteed to have
different values. </p>

<p>To pass a single 32-bit refnum to and from Lua, one option is to use <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Push _refnum_.vi">Push
(refnum)</a> or <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Pull _refnum_.vi">Pull (refnum)</a>
respectively. These VIs allow a &quot;Generic&quot; refnum to be passed. A
specific flavour of 32-bit reference will therefore need to be converted to/from the &quot;Generic&quot; class before/after pushing/pulling. When the refnum
you must pass is in a subclass of &quot;Generic&quot;, it is possible to use
&quot;To More Specific Class&quot; after pulling and &quot;To More Generic
Class&quot; before pushing. When the refnum is part of a different class
hierarchy, LabVIEW requires some more persuasion. See the implementation of <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Cast VI Ref to Gen Ref.vi">
Cast VI Ref to Gen Ref</a>  for an example of how this can be made to work. Alternatively, 32-bit refnums can be passed as flat data, be it single refnums
or as part of compound data. Most flavours are supported by <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Push _flat data_.vi">
Push (flat data)</a> and <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Pull _flat data_.vi">
Pull (flat data)</a>. To see if a flavour is supported, simply try to to push it
as flat data. When this does not result in an error, it is supported. Be sure to
not pull a refnum as the wrong flavour: though LabVIEW is likely to complain
when given such a refnum, there is a small chance of terminal confusion. </p>

<p>When you have some LabVIEW data structure that is not meant to be
visible to Lua and can be referenced via a 32-bit value, for example an array
index
that points to that data structure, an interesting option is to pass it as a 32-bit refnum to
Lua. By using a refnum instead of a 32-bit integer, you make explicit that the
value is opaque and make it impossible for Lua to interpret or modify the value. </p>

<h4><a name="String refnums">String refnums</a> </h4>

<p>Some LabVIEW refnums are represented internally as a string value (the ones
with thick purple-brown wires). VISA resource names and IVI logical names are
examples of such refnums. String refnums typically reflect an instrument
connected to some bus. The bus driver usually enumerates the connected
instruments and assigns names to them. On Windows, this process can be monitored
and influenced using the &quot;Measurement and Automation Explorer&quot; (MAX).
As long as the set of connected instruments, their IDs (if any), and the MAX configuration
are not changed,
these refnum strings (resource names) can be assumed to remain invariant. </p>

<p>On the Lua side, string refnums are also represented as strings. String
refnums, be it single refnums or as part of compound data, can be passed as flat
data. Most flavours are supported by <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Push _flat data_.vi">
Push (flat data)</a> and <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Pull _flat data_.vi">
Pull (flat data)</a>. To see if a flavour is supported, simply try to to push it
as flat data. When this does not result in an error, it is supported. </p>

<h4><a name="LuaVIEW objects">LuaVIEW objects</a> </h4>

<p>When you have some LabVIEW-side object/data, and it must be possible to
operate on or access information about this object/data from the Lua side, it is
often convenient (for script authors) to be able to treat it as if it were a true Lua
object. To this end, it is possible
to create a &quot;LuaVIEW object&quot; using <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Push _object_.vi"> Push
(object)</a>. Such objects hold a 32-bit refnum to identify your LabVIEW-side
object or data, and have an optional attached method table holding LuaVIEW functions
that operate on that type of object. In addition, you can attach read-only
attributes to the object using <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Set Object Attribute.vi">
Set Object Attribute</a>. Such objects are represented as &quot;user data&quot; in
Lua, and are passed by reference. </p>

<p>Given a LuaVIEW object, you can use the Lua method calling syntax
(<code>&lt;object&gt;:&lt;method&gt;(&lt;arguments&gt;)</code>) or access attributes
(<code>&lt;object&gt;.&lt;attribute&gt;</code>). Calling methods requires less typing since
the first (object) argument can be omitted. Also, it is impossible to pass the
wrong type of object to a function when calling it as a method. Use <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Pull _object_.vi"> Pull
(object)</a> 
to retrieve the object/data refnum. For an example of LuaVIEW object usage, see the
VIs that implement the <code>VI.*</code> LuaVIEW functions as well as the
scripts in the &quot;luaview/examples/VI handling&quot; subdirectory. </p>
