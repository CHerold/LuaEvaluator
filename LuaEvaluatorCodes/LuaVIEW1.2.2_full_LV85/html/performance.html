<h3>Performance considerations</h3>
<p>Avoid premature optimisation: only invest
time in performance when you are fairly sure, through estimation, calculation, or measurement,
that doing so will remove a bottleneck or allow for
better scaling. When you have a pure top-down design, some up-front estimation
is called for because refactoring will be painful. A bottom-up design can
be changed easily, which makes it reasonable to postpone worrying about
performance until measurements can be made. This appendix should help
you make such estimates and measurements, and points out possible trouble
spots.</p>

<p>Methodologically dubious tests suggest that LabVIEW is about two to three times
slower than C, and Lua is about twenty to thirty times slower than C, for comparable
tasks. This makes Lua sound slow, but it is actually leading performance
when <a href="http://dada.perl.it/shootout/craps.html">compared to other scripting
languages</a>. It is also irrelevant, most of the
time: scripting
languages are not used for the same tasks that application programming languages
are put to. Instead, scripting typically involves calling into C or LabVIEW, or
waiting for I/O or events. In such cases, the fraction of time spent
on executing Lua code tends to be negligible.</p>

<p>The performance difference between Lua and LabVIEW
is relevant only when you are considering whether to implement a pure Lua
algorithm that takes a long time to execute. In such a case, the trade off is between
programmer time saved during the implementation versus user time lost while the
program operates, unless you are obliged to hit some performance benchmark. The optimal
choice is a function of programming skills and the suitability of either
language to the problem. A pragmatic approach for complicated algorithms is to
prototype them in Lua and simply deploy the prototype when performance is
sufficient. Also note that, as a last resort, there is always the option to
use C or some other
language: both Lua (through <code>loadlib</code>) and LabVIEW can call DLLs.</p>

<p>Actually, it is rare to encounter a LabVIEW program that comes close to
extracting maximum performance: performance is often
dominated by overhead or scaling issues because programmers tend to choose convenience over performance. The lack of
data references often necessitates the copying of data in wires, thus causing a
performance hit when manipulating large data sets. One solution is to use a
LabVIEW2-style global that hides the full data set and provides access
via in-place operations, but this is a lot more work to set up for than simply
passing and branching a wire. A related issue is the pervasive use of subVIs.
This is convenient since it makes for smaller diagrams, more modular code, and
easier testing. On the flip side, subVIs have calling overhead and can cause the
allocation of additional data buffers. Large VI hierarchies have a lot of
initialisation overhead. Lastly, there is a tendency to put too much
functionality into a single contention-prone state machine since that allows for
less inconvenient code scheduling.</p>

<p>By using Lua, some of these issues can be avoided or resolved. Lua has tables
and table references. Using these to implement large data structures can reduce
overhead when the emphasis is on access and mutation instead of throughput. When
a Lua data structure must be available
throughout your program, hide it in a subVI implementing one or more
LabVIEW-callable Lua functions that access the data. When the data structure is associated with code
scheduling, make it part of a Lua script that also does the scheduling. Table references
make it practical to set up trees, heaps, and other
standard data structures that improve scalability. Tasks
make it easy to spawn independent execution contexts so as to decouple the
scheduling of subsystems. Lua code has a much smaller memory footprint
than comparable LabVIEW code. The LuaVIEW building blocks make bottom-up
programming practical which enables better code reuse.</p>

<p>Calling or passing data between Lua and LabVIEW involves more overhead than
LabVIEW to LabVIEW or Lua to Lua operations. This is due to the adaptations and
translations that are performed by LuaVIEW when switching between Lua and
LabVIEW. This functionality is implemented in C for speed. Even so, some
performance has been traded for security and convenience: the
functionality includes run-time type checks, argument checking, stack extension,
and the tracking of information
required for reporting errors. This was deemed to be a reasonable trade-off since
it allowed for a simpler API and robust error handling with readable messages.</p>

<p>Overhead becomes a bottleneck when the frequency with which it is incurred
approaches the inverse of the time lost per occurrence. This can happen when performing very
frequent calls or when passing lots of individual data items. In such a case,
performance can be improved by moving the innermost loop surrounding the call
into the function being called or by passing the data items as compound data.</p>

<p>The LuaVIEW-provided functions (<a href="luaview_functions.html#do_script"><code>do_script</code></a><code>,
</code><a href="luaview_functions.html#do_task"><code>do_task</code></a><code>, </code><a href="luaview_functions.html#run_task"><code>run_task</code></a>)
and API VIs (<a href="API.html#re_LuaVIEW Do Script.vi">Do Script</a>, <a href="API.html#re_LuaVIEW Do Task.vi">Do Task</a>,
<a href="API.html#re_LuaVIEW Run Task.vi">Run Task</a>) for compiling and
executing scripts all
instantiate a new virtual machine, and, in the case of tasks, also run a
top-level VI to create an independent execution context. This makes scripts and
tasks mutually independent: they cannot directly make each other fail or change each
other's variables. Any interactions must occur via explicit
LabVIEW-side mechanisms. This decoupling prevents unintended side effects. The
combined compilation and execution makes starting scripts as simple as with an interpreter.
The cost is extra overhead. When you need
to load and execute scripts very frequently or want to avoid repeated
compilation when executing code multiple times, use the
Lua-provided functions (<code>require</code>, <code>dofile</code>, <code>loadfile</code>,
or <code>loadstring</code>) instead.</p>

<p><a name="measuring"></a>Below follow some scripts that
perform performance measurements.</p>

<pre><code>N=1000000
t1=time()
for i=1,N,1 do
    j=i*i+1
end
t2=time()
print(N/(t2-t1)..&quot; simple calculations per second.&quot;)</code></pre>

<pre><code>N=500000
function foo() return 42 end
t1=time()
for i=1,N,1 do
    foo()
end
t2=time()
print(N/(t2-t1)..&quot; simple Lua to Lua calls per second.&quot;)</code></pre>

<pre><code>N=400000
t1=time()
for i=1,N,1 do
    sqrt(4)
end
t2=time()
print(N/(t2-t1)..&quot; simple Lua to C calls per second.&quot;)</code></pre>

<pre><code>N=100000
t1=time()
for i=1,N,1 do
    wait(0)
end
t2=time()
print(N/(t2-t1)..&quot; simple Lua to LabVIEW calls per second.&quot;)</code></pre>

<pre><code>N=10000
t1=time()
for i=1,N,1 do
    loadstring(&quot;--&quot;)()
end
t2=time()
print(N/(t2-t1)..&quot; trivial same-VM scripts per second.&quot;)</code></pre>

<pre><code>N=100
t1=time()
for i=1,N,1 do
    do_script(&quot;&quot;,&quot;--&quot;)
end
t2=time()
print(N/(t2-t1)..&quot; trivial new-VM scripts per second.&quot;)</code></pre>

<pre><code>N=50
t1=time()
for i=1,N,1 do
    do_task(&quot;&quot;,&quot;--&quot;)
end
t2=time()
print(N/(t2-t1)..&quot; trivial new tasks per second.&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>Of course, these scripts somewhat underestimate performance since
they do not take account of the overhead of the <code>for</code> loop. It
is often interesting to learn about latency instead of throughput. <a name="latency"></a> To measure latency, a script like the following can help out.</p>

<pre><code>lv.addcleanup(function()
    print(&quot;average latency = &quot;..sum/n..&quot; ms&quot;)
    print(&quot;max latency = &quot;..max..&quot; ms&quot;)
end)
max=0
sum=0
n=0
while true do
    t1=lv.tickcount()
    wait(1)
    t2=lv.tickcount()
    latency=lv.subU32(t2,t1)-1
    if latency&gt;max then
        max=latency
    end
    sum=sum+latency
    n=n+1
end</code></pre>

<p>The result has nothing to do with the script. Instead it reflects scheduling delays.
This provides a rough
indication of how long it might take a task or VI that runs at the same priority
and in the same execution system as the script to respond under load
conditions similar to those that held for the duration of the measurement.
Beware that only real-time operating
systems give guarantees for worst-case latencies.</p>
