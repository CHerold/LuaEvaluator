<h3>Organization of the LuaVIEW distribution</h3>
<p>The organization of the files and directories of the unpacked LuaVIEW
distribution is as follows:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>clientsrv/*</dt>
  <dd>By default this directory contains stubs that disable the client-server functionality.
    When you have installed the <a href="clientsrv_manual.html">client-server
    example framework</a>, the directory will instead the framework VIs and
    scripts.</dd>
  <dt>library/*</dt>
  <dd>SubVIs of general utility. Not part of the API.</dd>
  <dt>luaview/*</dt>
  <dd>All files related to scripting.</dd>
  <dt>luaview/examples/*</dt>
  <dd>Example VIs and scripts.</dd>
  <dt>luaview/examples/VI templates/*</dt>
  <dd>Templates of LuaVIEW building blocks ready to be reviewed and specialized.</dd>
  <dt>luaview/html/*</dt>
  <dd>Documentation of LuaVIEW, including this manual. Note that the online
    version of the manual will always describe the latest LuaVIEW release and
    may therefore mention functionality not yet present in earlier releases. To
    avoid confusion, always refer to the documentation included with the release
    being used.</dd>
  <dt>luaview/subvis/*</dt>
  <dd>API VIs.</dd>
  <dt>luaview/objects/*</dt>
  <dd>API VIs that operate on retained state. Such VIs have a "obj_*"
    prefix.</dd>
  <dt>*/dynamic/*</dt>
  <dd>Dynamically loaded and instantiated VIs and templates. Their VI
    descriptions specify to what functionality they belong. When building an
    application that includes that functionality, make sure to include the
    corresponding dynamic file via the &quot;Add Dynamic VI&quot; button of the
    application builder. Alternatively, the VIs can be included via a static
    reference somewhere inside the hierarchy of the top-level VI. This does not
    work for templates.&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt>*/functions/*</dt>
  <dd>A directory holding LuaVIEW functions. These VIs have a "*_lua.vi"
    postfix so as to allow them to be automatically registered even when built
    into an executable or llb. To reduce application size, include only required
    functions in the build script.</dd>
  <dt>*/private/*</dt>
  <dd> Do not use nor mind, these VIs concern internal functionality and are
    likely to change in future releases.</dd>
  <dt>*/served/*</dt>
  <dd>Remote calling wrappers for user interface VIs. When you choose to build one or more of the provided
    user interfaces into an application executable, check which of these are
    required. Since these VIs are dynamically loaded, they must be specifically
    included in the application builder script. By exclusively accessing
    the scripting subsystem through VI-server calls on these wrapper VIs, the
    user interfaces were made client-server capable. These VIs have a &quot;*_srv.vi&quot;
    postfix so that VI-server can easily be configured to limit remote calls to only
    this subset of VIs. Also, all these VIs have a certificate input which
    allows for server-side access checks: client-side checks are intrinsically
    insecure. Some of these VIs aggregate multiple API actions so as to minimize
    network latency overhead.&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt>*/unit tests/*</dt>
  <dd>The VIs and scripts in such directories are assumed to be tests designed
    for running by the "Unit Tester". They are automatically collected
    when the "Unit Tester" is run.</dd>
  <dt>re_*.vi</dt>
  <dd>Reentrant VIs.</dd>
  <dt>glb_*.vi</dt>
  <dd>Configuration globals. These have been given reasonable default values so
    that LuaVIEW functionality works without further configuration under the
    LabVIEW development environment. When creating an application that uses
    LuaVIEW you may wish to customise some of these values. Only change the
    configuration values when the application starts, not while it runs. This
    can be done via a <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Bootstrap.vi">bootstrap</a>
    script.</dd>
  <dt>tui_*.vi and ui_*.vi</dt>
  <dd>User-interface VIs.</dd>
  <dt>*.lua</dt>
  <dd>Lua scripts.</dd>
</dl>
