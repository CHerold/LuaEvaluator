<title>LuaVIEW Calling Mechanism</title>

<h3>The LuaVIEW calling mechanism</h3>
<p>The problem with integrating scripting languages into LabVIEW such that
LabVIEW can be called, and thus scripted, is that there is no API for
calling back into LabVIEW from C code called by LabVIEW. LuaVIEW solves this by
calling LabVIEW from LabVIEW via a specially constructed C function that
interrupts the virtual machine so that a LabVIEW to LabVIEW call can take place
instead.
This is evident when an error occurs inside a LabVIEW-side function that is
being called from Lua: the error message will contain both a Lua stack trace
that claims the error happened inside a C function, which is true from Lua's
perspective, and a call chain that claims that LabVIEW failed while calling
LabVIEW, which is true from LabVIEW's perspective. This mechanism is made
possible by the versatile virtual machine control and customisation features
offered by Lua.</p>
<p>One alternative means of scripting LabVIEW is to implement a scripting
language in LabVIEW (G). This has in fact been done for several specialized
scripting systems, but creating a general purpose language in LabVIEW that approaches
the quality of existing C-based scripting languages is a nearly impossible task.
Another alternative is to run scripts as part of&nbsp; an external
process, and implement a calling mechanism based on inter-process communication,
e.g. over TCP/IP. This is cumbersome in terms of deployment, initialisation, and
binding.
It also carries a large amount of overhead since two process switches are
required per call and arguments and results will have to be passed across
process boundaries. Advantages of the LuaVIEW approach are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scripts run inside the LabVIEW runtime: this enables a close integration
    between Lua and LabVIEW.</li>
  <li>No external processes need to be started.</li>
  <li>No external libraries need to be called.</li>
  <li>No limits on the number of simultaneous LabVIEW calls from scripts.</li>
  <li>Lua can call anything that LabVIEW can call.</li>
  <li>Interruption of the virtual machine can also be used to yield the current
    thread so that an unlimited number of scripts can run simultaneously.</li>
  <li>No process
    boundaries are crossed, no context switches need to be made.</li>
</ul>
<p>The lack of provisions for calling LabVIEW from C code running under the
LabVIEW runtime has to do with the special nature of
scheduling in LabVIEW. Instead of an execution context being defined by a thread
with an associated stack, LabVIEW is able to multiplex the available threads in
a cooperative and pre-emptive manner over the various bits of LabVIEW code that
require execution. Execution in a dataflow system is required when all input
data is available, and this has allowed LabVIEW to be designed to exploit
parallel processing for run-of-the-mill diagram code that has no special
provisions. This is an amazing and excellent feature. It makes that LabVIEW code
will happily scale along in these days of simultaneous multi threading and cheap
simultaneous multi processing without requiring
any further investment on the part of the programmer.</p>
<p>The above does suggest, with a high degree of confidence, that LabVIEW does
not store and restore C stack frames when it reschedules threads as this would
be both costly and a misfit of the data-flow paradigm. Instead LabVIEW looks at
the data structures associated with the compiled diagram to determine what has
to happen next. One consequence is that LabVIEW does not support recursive VI
calls. Another consequence is that when LabVIEW calls into C code (which does
require the C stack), the calling thread is blocked for the duration of the
execution of the C code. Furthermore, that C code will have difficulty with
calling back into LabVIEW. The reason is that, once called back to the LabVIEW
side, the thread stack holds the calling frames of all underlying C calls. Thus,
LabVIEW would either need to support a mechanism that stores and restores this
stack so that the thread can participate in normal scheduling (which is
technically difficult), or the thread must remain reserved while the
LabVIEW-side call is ongoing. The latter would limit the number of LabVIEW-side
calls to one less than the number of available threads, which makes it
incompatible with single threading mode and, in case of multi-threading, would
bring the runtime to a grinding halt when having more than a couple of active
scripts.</p>
<p>A disadvantage of the LuaVIEW calling mechanism is that LabVIEW cannot be
called via an additional C function: while a normal C function is being called,
the Lua virtual machine cannot be interrupted because the C stack cannot be
unwound. There are in fact a couple of C functions in the Lua C libraries that
take a function as a parameter and make calls on the passed function. When
passing a LabVIEW-side function to such a C function, a runtime error is thrown.
The same occurs when trying to call LabVIEW from a meta method: these are
implemented as internal C functions. You are
unlikely to encounter this issue unless you use meta tables, coroutines, or
elaborate
functional programming techniques. The most useful of
the offending C library functions is <code>pcall</code> which allows function
calls to be protected by catching their errors. To compensate, LuaVIEW provides
an alternate means of protecting LabVIEW calls (the <code><a href="lv_c-library_functions.html#lv.pcall">lv.pcall</a></code>
function) that works without making use of the C stack. Note that it is often possible to implement
equivalents of C functions in Lua, and Lua functions have no trouble with
calling into LabVIEW.</p>
