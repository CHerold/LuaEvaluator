<h3>Calling Lua</h3>

<p>This
appendix details how to create LabVIEW-callable Lua functions. This capability
allows Lua to be chosen as the implementation language for some self-contained
subVI or VI object (LabVIEW 2 style global). This is of value because Lua and
LabVIEW have quite different strengths and weaknesses: an algorithm that is
difficult to implement in LabVIEW may well be easy in Lua, and vice versa.</p>

<h4><a name="Restrictions">Restrictions</a></h4>

<p>LabVIEW-callable Lua functions cannot call back into LabVIEW. This restriction allows a
standard Lua calling mechanism to be used which results in better performance
and a simpler API. A future LuaVIEW release may add a separate mechanism that
does allow for LabVIEW-callable Lua functions to call back into LabVIEW.&nbsp;
LabVIEW-callable Lua functions can use the functions in the various C libraries.
A small set of C functions in the &quot;lv&quot; C library that involve
interruption of the virtual machine cannot be used. These functions are <a href="lv_c-library_functions.html#exit"><code>exit</code></a>,
<a href="lv_c-library_functions.html#wait"><code>wait</code></a>, <a href="lv_c-library_functions.html#lv.addcleanup"><code>lv.addcleanup</code></a>, <a href="lv_c-library_functions.html#lv.setyielding"><code>lv.setyielding</code></a>,
and <a href="lv_c-library_functions.html#lv.getyielding"><code>lv.getyielding</code></a>. As opposed to scripts, execution
of function calls is not interrupted regularly to allow for cooperative thread
scheduling. Thus, a LabVIEW to Lua call consumes a thread for its duration.
Typically, this is not a problem since LabVIEW has multiple threads per
execution system. When running LabVIEW in single-threading mode, or when calling
Lua from the one-and-only user-interface thread, thread contention can occur.
In such cases it is advisable to implement only brief functions.</p>

<h4><a name="How to wire function calls">How to wire function calls</a></h4>
<p>To call Lua, use the <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Push _poly_.vi">Push</a>, <a href="API.html#re_LuaVIEW Call.vi">Call</a>,
and <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Pull _poly_.vi">Pull</a> API VIs as follows:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="pics/calling_lua.png" width="438" height="137"></p>

<p> Both the push and pull API VIs are polymorphic. The
supported data types and their representations and conversions are <a href="datatypes.html">detailed
here</a>.</p>

<h4> <a name="Defining functions"> Defining functions</a></h4>

<p>Lua functions must be defined prior to being called from LabVIEW. Use <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Open Base State.vi">Open
Base State</a> to obtain a LuaVIEW state suited for calling and subsequently <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Compile.vi">Compile</a>
and <a href="API.html#re_LuaVIEW Execute.vi">Execute</a> one or more scripts containing function definitions:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="pics/defining_functions.png" width="329" height="105"></p>

<p>Scripts containing function definitions are subject to the same <a href="#Restrictions">restrictions</a>
as the functions themselves.</p>

<h4><a name="Handling multiple calls and callers">Handling multiple calls and
callers</a></h4>

<p>For performance reasons and to allow data that persists between calls, it is
desirable to avoid having to redefine functions for each call. This can be done
by caching the LuaVIEW reference for which function definitions were made. Also,
a Lua virtual machine instance as specified via a LuaVIEW reference supports
only a single operation at any one time. Consequently, no simultaneous calls can
be performed on the same LuaVIEW state. When you want to implement some utility
subVI or VI object using Lua that must be available to multiple callers, some
extra work is required to serialize calls.</p>

<p>Both requirements can be met by bundling all functionality for a particular
Lua function or set of Lua functions into a non-reentrant subVI containing an
unitialized shift register that holds the LuaVIEW reference. The implementations
of the examples discussed in the next sections show how to do so.</p>

<h4><a name="Example: converting data to/from text">Example: converting data
to/from text</a></h4>

<p>LuaVIEW can automatically convert between Lua and LabVIEW data types. The Lua
compiler can read text-based data definitions. Thus, almost all requirements for
automatically converting LabVIEW data to and from text are met. All that is
required in addition is a means of exporting Lua data as text. The
luaview/examples/Serialization.vi example demonstrates how Lua functions, called
through subVIs, can be used to perform one-step conversions in either direction.
Note that the conversion to text is relatively simple only by virtue of a
recursive implementation, which is easy to do in Lua.</p>

<h4><a name="Example: expression evaluation">Example: expression evaluation</a></h4>

<p>Since part of the job of the Lua parser/compiler is to parse arithmetic
expressions, Lua can be abused as an expression evaluator. The luaview/examples/Calculator.vi
example demonstrates a simple implementation thereof. It is notable for what is
does <i>not</i> do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It does not allow variables to be set, retrieved, or assigned from an
    expression.</li>
  <li>It does not allow for custom defined functions.</li>
  <li>It does not cache parsed expressions for efficient repeated evaluation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The luaview/examples/Expression Demo.vi example shows how to dress-up
expression evaluation to do all of the above. It makes use of a VI (luaview/examples/calling
lua/Caching Expression Evaluator.vi) that can be used in the very same manner as
a VI object (LabVIEW 2 style global): it has multiple methods and operates on
retained state. Only when examining the diagram of the VI does it become evident
that Lua instead of LabVIEW is used to implement the methods and retain state.
Note that a Lua table is used as the expression cache. Lua tables allow for the
easy implementation of efficient dynamic data structures: they can be
interlinked by reference and grow automagically as elements are added without
becoming slow to access.</p>

<h4><a name="Errors and the stack">Errors and the stack</a></h4>

<p>When reusing a LuaVIEW reference, you must make sure that the stack is empty
at the end of the operations associated with a call, otherwise the next call
will pass wrong arguments. Normally, this is not an issue: an
error that occurs during the function call, or while pushing arguments or
pulling results, causes the stack to be automatically cleared. However, when you
place some other subVI that can output an error between the first push and the
last pull surrounding a call, there is a risk that the stack does not get
cleared. For this reason, it is advisable to not interleave the push, call, and
pull sequence. Otherwise, it is mandatory to call <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Clear Stack.vi">Clear
Stack</a> in case of an error.</p>

<p>Sometimes you cannot be sure of the number of results returned by a Lua
function, in particular when you allow other programmers or the application user
to implement the function. In such a case, or simply as an additional check, it
is possible to specify the required number of results when using the <a href="API.html#re_LuaVIEW Call.vi">Call</a>
API VI. This is done by wiring the optional <b>required results</b> input. Any
mismatch between the number of required and returned results will cause a
descriptive error to be thrown, and the stack to be cleared. When the function
is allowed to return a variable number of results, query the number of <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Stack Elements.vi">Stack
Elements</a>
 on completion of the call and pull results accordingly.</p>
