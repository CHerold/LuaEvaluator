<h3>Creating LabVIEW-side functions</h3>

<p>By creating LabVIEW-side functions (aka LuaVIEW functions) you can make your
LabVIEW code callable from Lua. For some examples see the VIs contained in the
luaview/functions/ directory. They implement the functions documented <a href="luaview_functions.html">here</a>.
The luaview/examples/VI templates/ directory contains templates that can be specialised when
implementing one of the various LuaVIEW function types. The templates are fairly
self explanatory, but there are some details worth knowing. These are covered in
this appendix:</p>

</ul>
<h4><a name="How to wire functions">How to wire functions</a></h4>
<p>For all types of LuaVIEW function, the following basic steps must be wired in
the very same manner:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Pull any arguments passed from Lua.</li>
  <li>Call or execute some LabVIEW code that does whatever your function must
    do.</li>
  <li>Push any results back to Lua.</li>
  <li>Return any error.</li>
</ol>
<p>An example of how to wire up a function, in this case with two parameters and
two results, is shown below. How the corresponding
diagram is tied into the rest of the system differs between function types and
will be discussed later.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="pics/wiring_a_function.png" width="535" height="174"></p>
<p>On the input side, the diagram is provided with a reference to a LuaVIEW
state. This reference can be used to access the Lua stack that is used to pass
data between LabVIEW and Lua. <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Pull _poly_.vi">Pull</a>
all passed arguments until the stack is empty. If your function takes a
variable number of arguments, first use the <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Stack Elements.vi">Stack
Elements</a>
advanced VI to determine the number of arguments that were passed, and pull them
accordingly. Once your function has done what it must do, <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Push _poly_.vi">push</a> any results. Both the pull and push API VIs are polymorphic. The
supported data types and their representations and conversions are <a href="datatypes.html">detailed
here</a>.</p>
<p>On the output side, the function diagram can pass out an error cluster. When
your function completes successfully, a "no error" value should be
passed out. When an error occurs that causes your function to not be able to
complete its work, the corresponding error cluster must be passed out.</p>

<h4><a name="Naming functions">Naming functions</a></h4>
<p>On the Lua side, LuaVIEW functions are assigned to named variables so that
they can easily be called. You must therefore specify a function name that is a
valid Lua identifier. This means that it must start with a letter or an
underscore with the remainder being made up of alphanumerical characters
and/or underscores. Also, Lua function names may not collide with reserved names
such as Lua keywords. Try to choose a function name that reflects what the
function does. It is advisable but not mandatory to start the function name with
a lowercase character. This matches the widely used naming convention that has
variables start with lowercase, "classes" start with uppercase, and
"constants" in all uppercase.</p>
<p>You can optionally specify a table name as a prefix, which must also be a
valid identifier. If you do not do so, the function name is set as a global Lua
variable. If you do specify a table name, a table will be created as a global
variable with that name, and all functions that use that table prefix are put
into that table. This allows functions with related functionality to be grouped
into what can be said to be function libraries. Functions that work as methods
on a particular type of <a href="datatypes.html#LuaVIEW objects">LuaVIEW object</a> are best grouped under a table that starts
with an uppercase letter so that it has the appearance of a class. This also
allows them to be easily attached to new object instances</p>
<p>The above describes how to choose a function name. To learn how the chosen
name can be attached to your function's implementation so that it automatically
gets set on the Lua side, read on.</p>
<h4><a name="The calling synopsis">The calling synopsis</a></h4>
<p>Every LuaVIEW function requires a calling synopsis. This is a text string that
summarizes how the function must be called and what return values can be expected
on its completion. This serves a number of purposes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>It tells LuaVIEW what function name and table to use when making the
    function available to Lua.</li>
  <li>It serves as a very brief documentation of the function.</li>
  <li>It allows automatic <a href="#Argument checking"> argument checking</a> to be performed.</li>
  <li>It is included in the error messages generated when the wrong number or
    type of arguments are used when calling the function.</li>
  <li>It serves as an enum entry that selects the function implementation for
    certain types of LuaVIEW functions, thereby also providing a degree of
    documentation to the diagram.</li>
</ol>
<p>The
calling synopsis includes the function name, an optional
table prefix, as well as parameter (a function has parameters and should be called
with corresponding arguments) and result lists. Its syntax is as follows:</p>
<p><code>[&lt;type>:&lt;result>,...=][&lt;table>.]&lt;function>([&lt;type>:&lt;parameter>],...)</code></p>
<p>The <code>&lt;function&gt;</code>  and &lt;table&gt; fields hold the
corresponding names. The
square brackets denote optional elements. The ellipses (...) denote zero or more
repeats of the prior item. Any <code>&lt;type&gt;</code> fields should be filled in with an
abbreviation string specifying the data type required from Lua or passed back to
Lua. This can be one of
<b>any</b>, <b>bool</b>, <b>num</b>, <b>obj</b>, <b>ref</b>, <b>str</b>, <b>tab</b>,
<b>I8</b>, <b>U8</b>, <b>I16</b>, <b>U16</b>, <b>I32</b>, or <b>U32</b>. The <code>&lt;result&gt;</code>  and &lt;parameter&gt; fields should be given
short, descriptive names that can pass as Lua identifiers. When the function takes a variable number of arguments, or returns a variable
number of results, this should be denoted in the synopsis by adding square
brackets around the last item in the parameter or result list and/or by trailing
the list with an ellipsis.</p>
<p>To see how this works, consider the following examples:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>foo()</code></dt>
  <dd>A function named "foo" that must be called without arguments and returns
no results.</dd>
  <dt><code>foo.bar()</code></dt>
  <dd>A function named "bar" must be called without arguments and returns
no results and is set as an element of table/library "foo".</dd>
  <dt><code>foo(num:x)</code></dt>
  <dd>A function named "foo" that has a single numerical parameter named
"x" and returns no results.</dd>
  <dt><code>foo(num:y,str:s)</code></dt>
  <dd>A function named "foo" that must be called with two arguments, a
number and a string. It returns no results.</dd>
  <dt><code>bar(num:z,[str:t])</code></dt>
  <dd>A function named "bar" that must be called with a number and an
optional string. It returns no results.</dd>
  <dt><code>bar(bool:flag,str:first,...)</code></dt>
  <dd>A function named "bar" that must be called with a Boolean and one or
more strings.</dd>
  <dt><code>bool:ok,num:result=bar([any:thing],...)</code></dt>
  <dd>A function named "bar" can be called with zero or more arguments
    of any type and returns two results, a Boolean and a number.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The means by which the calling synopsis of a function is specified and
handled is dependent on the function type.</p>
<h4><a name="Argument checking">Argument checking</a></h4>
<p>The data type abbreviations specified for the function parameters in the
calling synopsis are used to perform automated argument checking. This is done
prior to the actual function call. When mismatching arguments are passed when
calling a LabVIEW-side function, an explanatory error is automatically generated
without requiring extra work when implementing the function. The type codes
specified in the synopsis place the following requirements on the Lua items
passed as arguments:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>any:</b>    any argument type and value is allowed.</li>
  <li><b>bool:</b>  argument must be a Boolean.</li>
  <li><b>num:</b>  argument must a number, or a string that can be converted into a
    number.</li>
  <li><b>obj:</b> argument must be a LuaVIEW object.</li>
  <li><b>ref:</b> argument must be a 32 bit LabVIEW reference number.</li>
  <li><b>str:</b>  argument must be a string or a number (the number gets
    converted into a string).</li>
  <li><b>tab:</b> argument must be a table.</li>
  <li><b>I8:</b>  must convert precisely into a signed 8 bit integer: argument
    must a number, or a string that converts into a number, with an integer
    value that may range from -128 to 127.</li>
  <li><b>U8:</b>  must convert precisely into an unsigned 8 bit integer:
    argument must a number, or a string that converts into a number, with an
    integer value that may range from 0 to 255.</li>
  <li><b>I16:</b>  must convert precisely into an signed 16 bit integer:
    argument must a number, or a string that converts into a number, with an
    integer value that may range from -32768 to 32767.</li>
  <li><b>U16:</b>  must convert precisely into an unsigned 16 bit integer:
    argument must a number, or a string that converts into a number, with an
    integer value that may range from 0 to 65535.</li>
  <li><b>I32:</b>  must convert precisely into an signed 32 bit integer:
    argument must a number, or a string that converts into a number, with an
    integer value that may range from -2147483648 to 2147483647.</li>
  <li><b>U32:</b>  must convert precisely into an unsigned 32 bit integer:
    argument must a number, or a string that converts into a number, with an
    integer value the may range from 0 to 4294967295.</li>
</ul>

<p>The built-in argument checking is a first line of defence against typos and
other programming errors in scripts that call LabVIEW. Often, functions require
argument values that cover a more specific range than what is allowed by
argument checking. In such cases, make sure that your function will fail in a
reasonable manner when passed an out-of-range or invalid value. If not, perform
some further argument checks, and throw explanatory errors, as part of your
function's implementation.</p>
<p>All but <b>any</b> and <b>tab</b> map to a particular LabVIEW data type that can
be directly pulled. For such parameters, the function's implementation can make
do with a series of pull VI calls that matches the parameter list in the
synopsis. In case of an <b>any</b> parameter, the type being pulled is typically
conditional. In case of a <b>tab</b> parameter, the argument is typically <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Pull _flat data_.vi">pulled as flat data</a>
into an array or cluster.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><a name="Function results">Function results</a></h4>
<p>LuaVIEW function results are not checked. The rationale is that scripts are likely to be
frequently changed, which might cause typos in arguments to be introduced.
Results, on the other hand, are determined by the LabVIEW diagram of the
function, which is unlikely to change, and should have been tested before deployment.
The type codes in the result list
of the synopsis merely serve to inform the script writer of what result
values can be assumed to be returned. When you specify a result type code, you
promise that the script writer can assume one of the following:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>any:</b> the type of result can vary, the function's documentation
    should detail how.</li>
  <li><b>bool:</b>   result is a Boolean.</li>
  <li><b>num:</b>   result is a number.</li>
  <li><b>obj:</b>  result is a LuaVIEW object.</li>
  <li><b>ref:</b> result is a 32 bit LabVIEW reference number.</li>
  <li><b>str:</b>   result is a string.</li>
  <li><b>tab:</b>  result is a table.</li>
  <li><b>I8:</b>   result is an integer number ranging from -128 to 127.</li>
  <li><b>U8:</b>   result is a positive integer number ranging from 0 to 255.</li>
  <li><b>I16:</b>   result is an integer number ranging from -32768 to 32767.</li>
  <li><b>U16:</b>   result is a positive integer number ranging from 0 to 65535.</li>
  <li><b>I32:</b>   result is an integer number ranging from -2147483648 to 2147483647.</li>
  <li><b>U32:</b>   result is a positive number integer ranging from 0 to 4294967295.</li>
</ul>

<p>All but <b>any</b> and <b>tab</b> map to LabVIEW data types that can be
directly pushed. Often, the range of values being pushed is more restricted than
indicated by the type code. When knowledge of these further restrictions is useful
when writing scripts, specify them in the function's documentation.
Sometimes, you may wish to specify a less specific result type code in the
synopsis than the type being pushed, e.g. when it is not desirable that a
scripts
assumes an integer result to be integer because a future implementation might
instead return floating point values. When a result can be of a variable type, specify the <b>any</b>
type code and detail in the function's documentation what types these can be. To return a table, <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Push _flat data_.vi">push a cluster or
array as flat data</a> and document its
content.</p>

<h4><a name="Errors">Errors</a></h4>
<p>When it is doable for a function to recover from an error, or to retry a
flaky operation until it succeeds, the function should preferably be written to
attempt such recovery. For most errors though, recovery is impractical or
impossible so that the function must fail. To have a function fail, simply
return the error on the <b>error out</b> wire. On returning with an error to Lua,
the stack will be cleared: no additional stack
manipulation is required when the function fails before all arguments are pulled
or after results have partially been pushed. As detailed in the <a href="manual.html#Error handling">manual
section on error handling</a>, the handling can be separated from error sources
so that LuaVIEW functions need not concern themselves with what happens to any
errors they return.</p>
<h4><a name="Public and private functions">Public and private functions</a></h4>
<p>Both public and private functions are created in the very same manner. Their
difference stems from how you <a href="manual.html#Registering function VIs">register</a> them with Lua. To turn a
function VI into a public function, add it to the public function registry.
This makes the VI available to all subsequently started Lua scripts. The VI of a
public function VI cannot be unloaded while scripts other than those that that
specifically refrain from using public functions (by using <a href="API.html#LuaVIEW Open Private State.vi">Open
Private State</a>) have an open LuaVIEW state. Function VIs become private when
added to the private function registry of a LuaVIEW state. When all states with which
a private function was registered are closed (which normally happens after the
corresponding scripts are done), the function VI is unloaded unless something
else is holding a reference to it.</p>
<p>Usually, you will want to make function VIs public so that they can be called
by all scripts.
Private registration can be used when you want the VI to load
and unload on demand or the function to be available only to select scripts. To create a public or private function, make a copy of an
existing function VI or clone the &quot;luaview/examples/VI templates/function_template_lua.vit&quot; template
and <a href="#How to wire functions">wire up</a> the requisite functionality.
Function VIs are dynamically called. For this to work, they must all adhere
to the same connector pane layout, which has a LuaVIEW reference as input and an
error cluster as output.</p>
<p>The function name and optional table are
extracted from the file name. For this to work, the filename must accord to the
following syntax:</p>
<p><code>[re_][&lt;table&gt;.]&lt;name&gt;[_alternate&lt;id&gt;]_lua.vi</code></p>
<p>This ensures that the file name of a function VI is always in-sync with the name of
that function as visible to Lua. To change the function name, simply rename the
VI. The "_lua.vi" postfix allows the VI to be recognized as being a
function. This is used when automatic registration of public functions is
enabled (which is the default setting in "glb_LuaVIEW Configuration Globals.vi")
and allows the "Function Manager" to discriminate function VIs from
other VIs. The optional "re_" prefix can be used to mark a
function as being reentrant. This is not mandatory, but it is advisable since
the reentrancy flag is hidden yet can markedly affect the behaviour of a VI. For
this reason, all reentrant VIs that are part of the LuaVIEW distribution use
this prefix. To make a function VI reentrant, simply set the checkbox that can
be found in the VI properties dialog under the "Execution" section. As
a general rule, functions should only be made reentrant when they are frequently
used and run for a protracted time, or wait around for asynchronous actions to
complete. The how and why of reentrancy is detailed in the <a href="#Reentrance">section
on reentrance</a>.</p>
<p>The optional "_alternate&lt;id&gt;" postfix, which does not affect
the function name, can be used to override function VIs. LabVIEW cannot load
multiple VIs with the same name. LuaVIEW cannot allow the unloading of a
function VI that might still be in use by scripts. To override a function VI
while scripts are running, this postfix can therefore be used as it allows the
same function name for a different VI name. When overriding the same function
multiple times, use the additional "&lt;id&gt;", which can be anything
unique. Note that the overriding function VI is available only to scripts that start
after it is publicly registered. Private registration always must provide the VI
name so that the version of a function to use is always explicit in the using
script.</p>
<p>For LuaVIEW function VIs, the calling synopsis need not be directly specified. Instead, these
functions must be documented via the "Edit Function Documentation"
window that can be opened via the "Function Manager". This window will
guide you through the documentation process and ensures that the proper
documentation format is adhered to. The synopsis is automatically
constructed from this documentation as well as the function VI name. When saving
the documentation from the edit window, it and the synopsis are persisted with
the function VI file (using a LabVIEW metadata mechanism). This makes the
synopsis available to LuaVIEW when a function VI is registered.</p>

<h4><a name="Indexed functions and module functions">Indexed functions and
module functions</a></h4>

<p>For an indexed or module function, only a synopsis is required. More extensive documentation is
optional. The implementation of such a functions is typically contained in a case
structure case selected via an index. By casting the index to an enum
whose items define the function synopses, the case structure is automatically
provided with a limited degree of documentation. Using a case structure allows multiple indexed
or module functions to be implemented on a single
diagram. Consequently, such functions can easily exchange data via shared
state placed in an un-initialised shift register. To learn more examine "Lua-Driven
State Machine.vit" and "Module Template.vit" in the luaview/examples/VI
templates/ directory.</p>

<h4><a name="Reentrance">Reentrance</a></h4>

<p>Reentrant functions can be called from multiple scripts simultaneously while
non-reentrant functions block additional callers while a prior call is still
executing so that calls always execute one after the other. All C
functions included in the LuaVIEW toolkit are reentrant. Whether a C function in
a library that you dynamically link via <code>loadlib</code> is reentrant
depends on the library. For Lua-implemented functions, reentrancy is irrelevant
since they are compiled independently for different LuaVIEW states, and each
state has an independent virtual machine. Only recursive Lua functions need to
worry about multiple ongoing calls. Public and private functions are reentrant
when their function VI is set to execute reentrantly as described in the
previous section.</p>

<p>The manner in which LabVIEW achieves reentrancy is
somewhat peculiar when compared to other languages. On loading a VI that calls a
reentrant VI on&nbsp; its diagram, LabVIEW instantiates a new data space for
that reentrant VI so that all storage is duplicated for each of its diagram
instances. This includes the storage associated with further reentrant VIs
called from that reentrant VI. Thus, each diagram instance of a reentrant VI causes allocation of a tree of data spaces when nested reentrant
VIs are used. This can eat up lots of memory and increase VI load times. To
achieve good concurrency at reasonable cost, one should make only VIs that are likely to be contended reentrant. Another reason for making a VI reentrant is as
a convenient means for that VI to retain state for a particular diagram instance
across multiple calls.</p>

<p>For reentrant function VIs called from Lua there is no equivalent of a
"diagram instance". Instead, what happens is that the data space of
the reentrant VI is instantiated for each LuaVIEW state from which it is called.
This happens on the first call made to that reentrant VI. Consequently data
spaces are allocated only as needed. Calls to a re-entrant LuaVIEW function made
on different script lines from the same LuaVIEW state therefore all share the
same data space. Normally this is irrelevant, since typical functions will not
retain state across calls. But it can be used to easily implement per-LuaVIEW-state storage on the LabVIEW side, e.g. using an un-initialised shift register.</p>

<p>Functions of the same module instance are never reentrant even when the
module is instantiated off a reentrant VI. What is more, the various functions
of the same module instance are mutually blocking. Since modules can encapsulate
state on which its functions operate, the serialized access this enforces is
actually desirable. It does however imply that a particular module should
preferably not be made to contain overly much functionality as this might lead
to contention, that is, one caller having to wait for another caller.</p>
