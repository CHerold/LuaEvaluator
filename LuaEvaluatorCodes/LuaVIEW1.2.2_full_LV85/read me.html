<p>
This is the full LuaVIEW 1.2.1 release that includes the client-server framework and SCADA/datalogging
add-on. The VIs were patched for and recompiled with LabVIEW version 8.5.1. In addition,
some additional unit tests for the data logger and project files for building a client and
server executables are included.
</p>

<p>
This distribution was created to provide an easy download that shows off all the
LuaVIEW and SCADA features under LabVIEW 8.5 or higher while also providing an
example of how to build client and server executables. To this end, two project files
are included: Client.lvproj and Server.lvproj.
</p>

<p>
The server is a minimal server that dynamically loads the VIs from
and external file hierarchy thus making it easy to upgrade. The first
time you run the server as a built executable, you must point it to
the VI to run. Two example servers were included:
clientsrv/ClientSrv Example Server.vi (only shows client-server functionality)
datalog/DataLog Example Server.vi. (shows datalogging functionality as well)
</p>

<p>
When running the server as a
built executable, the viSearchPath entry in the application executable's
INI file should point to any further required subVIs such as a copy
of vi.lib and instr.lib. Please read the datalog/build/readme.txt file
for further details on this minimal build scheme.
</p>

<p>
Once the server is running, you can start the client and connect to
it by selecting the Server>Connect menu item. When testing on a
single machine, you can enter "localhost" as machine names. The
passwords can be left empty until you set them in the access.lua
script. You can change the run state of the server by selecting
a runlevel from the Server>Runlevels submenu. In particular, you
can stop the server, or switch it up to a level with all features
enabled (the "drivers" runlevel for the datalogging example
server).
</p>

<p>
Another reason for providing this release is that LabVIEW 8.2 introduced a
<a href="http://digital.ni.com/public.nsf/allkb/8545726A00272EB0862571DA005B896C">
backwards incompatibility</a> such that built executables
can no longer be treated as an LLB when it comes to finding and loading VIs.
Hence, LuavIEW users were experiencing some issues to get built applications
to properly load function VIs and other dynamic VIs since LuaVIEW made use of
the LLB feature.
